In order to run the server you will need to create .env. files with the names of the names of PGDATABASE that you wish to use. In this case it is a development database and a test database for the storage of a news application.

eg. inside a .env.test file you would have 'PGDATABASE=database_name_test' on the first line, where the database names can be found in setup.sql in which the databases are created.
